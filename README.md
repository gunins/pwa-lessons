## Motivation

Currently in Javascript world, is lot of talks about "Functional programming", and great frameworks libraries like 
Angular/React/Vue and much more not so well known. In lot of organisations is no requirement for javascript knowledge.
Priority is some framework knowledge, which is wrong. Frameworks are changing over times, also regards to new features in a browser, 
lot of framework/libraries features are obsolete. Examples from past jQuery.animate replaced by css3 animations, ajax libraries 
replaced by fetch API. And of course Promises now are built in.

No matter of what framework you are using, your web app structure and patterns will stay same. I'll try to do over the several lessons
to go step by step, how to plan you app structure functional way. With no any frameworks or libraries. And maybe in later stage
how to use same pattern with different frameworks.

## Prerequisites

Javascript and es6 knowledge required. I not explain basics of Javascript, for some advance features, will give reference links.
To test code, you will need latest Chrome, because I'll use es6 Modules, but not any gulp, Rollup, ur Grunt.
