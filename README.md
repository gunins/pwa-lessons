## Motivation

Current market selling lot of web frameworks such as Angular/React/Vue etc. Many developers coding
now without understanding, where is framework functionality, and where is Javascript alone.

I'll write some tutorials, to show how to write complex web applications, with pure Javascript, modular and functional way. 
Reason for these tutorials, is not to say, frameworks are good or bad, but you will understand how they works.

Also I want if you get feeling how powerful is Functional programming, and how useful is category theory patterns in javascript.


## Prerequisites

Javascript and es6 knowledge required. I'll not explain basics of Javascript, for some advance features, will give reference to links.
To run code, you need Chrome with es6 Module support. All examples we will run in browser instead of Rollup, or webpack.
